# Linear_combo_SpecCode

This code computes a linear combination of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, their overlap coefficients and plots their transition energies producing a vibronic spectra. The code is intended to capture anharmonic affects found in Morse potentials, but due to the instability of Morse wavefunctions, the linear combo method is developed such that it can be applied to 2D spectra.

The spec_pkg/ has been added and adapted to run the LC_Morse method fully integrated in to Tim's Mol Spec code for linear spectroscopy. Additionally jupyter notebook pages are added to provide analysis tools for visualizing the harmonic or morse wavefucntions and their overlaps.

Currently in the works is the adaptation of the LC_morse method to 2DES spectra...
