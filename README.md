# Linear_combo_SpecCode

This code computes a linear combination of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, their overlap coefficients and plots their transition energies producing a vibronic spectra. The code is intended to capture anharmonic affects found in Morse potentials, but due to the instability of Morse wavefunctions, the linear combo method is developed such that it can be applied to 2D spectra.
