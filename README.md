# Linear_combo_SpecCode

This code is a modification of Tim's Mol Spec code such that a linear combination of harmonic oscillaotrs method is added to approximate Morse wavefunctons. This code prints out Morse_LC linear and nonlinear (2DES and Transient Abs) spectra. Additionally jupyter notebook pages are added to provide analysis tools for visualizing the harmonic or morse wavefucntions and their overlaps.

Currently in the works is the Exact Emission spectrum for Morse Exact method...
